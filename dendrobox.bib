	abstract = {The International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) is
                  the main public archive of digital tree-ring
                  parameters. Due to its comprehensive spatio-temporal
                  coverage, its ring-width data is acknowledged in
                  many studies where high-resolution proxies of
                  climate or tree-growth are needed on large scales.
                  A main drawback of existing approaches to browsing
                  the ITRDB is the lack of an easy and interactive
                  visualization of the records and their connection to
                  the climate at point. Dendrobox aims at filling this
                  gap, and provides a web-based interface to more than
                  2400 ring-width records in the ITRDB for exploring
                  chronology characteristics and the
                  dendroclimatological potential of the records.
                  Possible applications of Dendrobox include
                  identifying records with a specific climate
                  response, demonstrating the relations of tree-growth
                  and climate in teaching, or simply playing with an
                  impressive data set without the hassle of setting up
                  analytical tools.},
